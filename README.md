# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models


Nonprofit foundation "Alphabet Soup" is a a philanthropic foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment and prove people's well-being and unify the world. "Alphabet Soup" has raised and donated over $10 billion in the past 20 years.<br> This money has been used to invest in a life saving technologies and organized reforestation groups around the world. Unfortunately, not every donation the company makes is impactful.<br> In some cases, an organization will take the money and  disappear as a result.<br><br> "Alphabet soups" President Andy Glad has asked me and my team to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. He wants us to create a mathematical, data-driven solution that can do this accurately.<br> We decided that this problem is too complex for the statistical, machine learning. <br>Instead we will design and train a Deep Learning Neural Network.<br> This model will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision making result.<br> A neural network is a powerful machine learning technique that is modeled after neurons in the brain.<br> Neural networks can rival the performance of the most robust statistical algorithms without having to worry about any statistical theory.<br> In this analysis, we will train, evaluate, and export neural network models to use in any scenario with the help of the Python TensorFlow Library.



## Results:

The main purpose of Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by "Alphabet Soup". <br><br>
From Alphabet Soup’s business team, we received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.<br> Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

* EIN and NAME — Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE — Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION — Government organization classification
* USE_CASE — Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION — Organization type
* STATUS — Active status
* INCOME_AMT — Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special consideration for application
* ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL — Was the money used effectively
